How to Install and Configure MySQL in Ubuntu 20.04 LTS

MySQL, which stands for My (co-founder Michael Widenius’ daughter name) Structured Query Language,
is an open source relational database management system.
This RDBMS is supported by Oracle and runs on almost all platforms such as Linux, UNIX and MS Windows.
MYSQL is usually the first choice for online publishing and web-based applications. Facebook, YouTube
and Twitter all use MySQL as their RDBMS. MySQL is part of the very popular LAMP stack:
 Linux, Apache, MySQL and Python/PHP/Perl.

In this article we describe step by step how to proceed:

Install the latest version of MySQL available in the apt package repository
Run the MySQL security script
Configure the root user to access the MySQL shell
Finally test that MySQL is running

We have run the commands and procedures mentioned in this article on an Ubuntu 20.04 LTS system

MySQL installation and security configuration

In this section, we describe how to install MySQL from the Ubuntu command line and configure security.

You can open the Ubuntu command line, the terminal, either from the application launcher search bar or
by pressing Ctrl+Alt+T.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 1: Update repository index
To install the latest available version of a software from the Internet repositories,
your local repository index must match it. Run the following command as sudo to update your
local repository index:

$ sudo apt-get update

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 2: Install MySQL server with apt
Please run the following command as sudo to install MySQL from APT repositories.

$ sudo apt-get install mysql-server
Please note that only an authorized user on Ubuntu can add, remove and configure software.

Install MySQL server package

The system may ask you for the password for sudo and also offer you a Y/n option to continue the installation.
 Type Y and then press Enter; MySQL will then be installed on your system. However,
 the process may take some time depending on your internet speed.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 3: Verify the installation (optional)
You can verify your MySQL installation and also check the version number by running the following command in your terminal:

$ mysql --version

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 4: Make security configurations by running the provided security script
Whenever you install a new copy of MySQL, there are some default settings that you should change to
increase the security of your MySQL installation. These include removing test users, test databases,
and allowing remote login by a root user.

Run the following command as sudo to start the security script:

$ sudo mysql_secure_installation

When you run this command, the first thing you will be prompted to do is set up the Validate Password plugin.
This allows you to set a secure password for root, depending on the strength of the password you want to choose.
Type Y to start the Validate Password plugin and you will get the following prompt:
Password validation policy level
Enter the number of your choice for the password strength and press Enter.
 The system will then ask you for the new password of root.
 Type the password and retype it at the following prompts.

Set MySQL root password
The system will then display the strength of the password you provided and also ask you
if you want to continue with the password.
Password strength
Type Y for Yes and press Enter.
The system will now ask you a series of questions, one at a time, and you can set the security of your
system depending on your answers to these questions.

Configuring root to use the MySQL shell
When running the security script, you specified a password for root. However, this user
is not allowed to connect to MySQL Shell with the same password. You can configure root to use
MySQL Shell by changing its authentication method from the default “auth_socket” to “mysql_native_password”.

Here’s how to do it:

Step 1: Start MySQL Shell
First, start the MySQL shell by running the following command as sudo:

$ sudo mysql
This will start the MySQL shell so you can work on the MySQL prompt.
