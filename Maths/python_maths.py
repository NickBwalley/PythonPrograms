"""
Python has a set of built-in math functions, including an extensive math module,
that allows you to perform mathematical tasks on numbers.
"""
# Built-in Math Functions
# The min() and max() functions can be used to find the lowest or highest value in an iterable:
x = min(5, 10, 25)
y = max(5, 10, 25)
print(x)
print(y)

# The abs() function returns the absolute (positive) value of the specified number:
x = abs(-7.25)
print(x)

print()

# The pow(x, y) function returns the value of x to the power of y (x^y).
# Return the value of 4 to the power of 3 (same as 4 * 4 * 4):
x = pow(4, 3)
print(x)
print()

"""
The Math Module
Python has also a built-in module called math, which extends the list of mathematical functions.

To use it, you must import the math module:
"""
import math

# When you have imported the math module, you can start using methods and constants of the module.
#
# The math.sqrt() method for example, returns the square root of a number:
x = math.sqrt(64)
print(x)
print()

# The math.ceil() method rounds a number upwards to its nearest integer,
# and the math.floor() method rounds a number downwards to its nearest integer, and returns the result:
x = math.ceil(1.4)
y = math.floor(1.4)

print(x) # returns 2
print(y) # returns 1
print()

# The math.pi constant, returns the value of PI (3.14...):
x = math.pi
print(x)
print()
