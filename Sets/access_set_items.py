# You cannot access items in a set by referring to an index or a key.
#
# But you can loop through the set items using a for loop, or
# ask if a specified value is present in a set, by using the in keyword
# loop through a set and print the values in the set
this_set = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
for x in this_set:
    print(x)
# check if banana is present in the set
print("banana" in this_set) # return boolean
# Once a set is created, you cannot change its items, but you can add new items.
