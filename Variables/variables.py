'''
CASTING IN PYTHON: If you want to specify the data type of a variable, this can be done with casting.
'''
x = str(3)
y = int(3)
z = float(3)
print(x)
print(y)
print(z)
# GET THE TYPE OF VARIABLE
print(type(x))
print(type(y))
print(type(z))
# NOTE: VARIABLES ARE CASE SENSITIVE
# String variables can be declared by using either single or double quotes
'''
VARIABLES NAMING CONVENTIONS:
A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
A variable name cannot start with a number
A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)

# Camel Case
myVariableName = "John"
# Pascal Case
MyVariableName = "John"
# Snake Case
